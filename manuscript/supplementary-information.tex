\subsection*{Weighted interval score}
\label{sec:wis}

The weighted interval score (smaller values are better) is a proper scoring rule for quantile forecasts. It converges to the continuous ranked probability score (which itself is a generalisation of the absolute error to probabilistic forecasts) for an increasing number of intervals. The score can be decomposed into a dispersion (uncertainty) component and penalties for over- and underprediction. For a single interval, the score is computed as 
  $$IS_\alpha(F,y) = (u-l) + \frac{2}{\alpha} \cdot (l-y) \cdot 1(y \leq l) + \frac{2}{\alpha} \cdot (y-u) \cdot 1(y \geq u), $$ 
  where $1()$ is the indicator function, $y$ is the true value, and $l$ and $u$ are the $\frac{\alpha}{2}$ and $1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}$ quantiles of the predictive distribution $F$, i.e., the lower and upper bound of a single prediction interval. For a set of $K$ prediction intervals and the median $m$, the score is computed as a weighted sum, 
  $$WIS = \frac{1}{K + 0.5} \cdot \left( w_0 \cdot |y - m| + \sum_{k = 1}^{K} w_k \cdot IS_{\alpha}(F, y) \right), $$
  where $w_k$ is a weight for every interval. Usually, $w_k = \frac{\alpha_k}{2}$ and $w_0 = 0.5$.

A: Observed daily (bars) and weekly (black lines and points) numbers of cases and deaths as available through the European Forecast Hub when the study concluded in 2021. Daily numbers were multiplied by seven in order to appear on the same scale as weekly numbers. Red dots represent days for which the original data and the revised data disagreed by more than five percent. B: Revised data available as of February 14 2023. In August, Johns Hopkins University that provided the data switched the data stream for their death forecasts to reflect the number of death certificates that mentioned COVID-19 rather than the number of people who died within 28 days of a positive test. C: Difference between the original and revised weekly death numbers.}
