  abstract = {Forecasts based on epidemiological modelling have played an important role in shaping public policy throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. This modelling combines knowledge about infectious disease dynamics with the subjective opinion of the researcher who develops and refines the model and often also adjusts model outputs. Developing a forecast model is difficult, resource- and time-consuming. It is therefore worth asking what modelling is able to add beyond the subjective opinion of the researcher alone. To investigate this, we analysed different real-time forecasts of cases of and deaths from COVID-19 in Germany and Poland over a 1-4 week horizon submitted to the German and Polish Forecast Hub. We compared crowd forecasts elicited from researchers and volunteers, against a) forecasts from two semi-mechanistic models based on common epidemiological assumptions and b) the ensemble of all other models submitted to the Forecast Hub. We found crowd forecasts, despite being overconfident, to outperform all other methods across all forecast horizons when forecasting cases (weighted interval score relative to the Hub ensemble 2 weeks ahead: 0.89). Forecasts based on computational models performed comparably better when predicting deaths (rel. WIS 1.26), suggesting that epidemiological modelling and human judgement can complement each other in important ways.},

  abstract = {Evaluating forecasts is essential in order to understand and improve forecasting and make forecasts useful to decision-makers. Much theoretical work has been done on the development of proper scoring rules and other scoring metrics that can help evaluate forecasts. In practice, however, conducting a forecast evaluation and comparison of different forecasters remains challenging. In this paper we introduce scoringutils, an R package that aims to greatly facilitate this process. It is especially geared towards comparing multiple forecasters, regardless of how forecasts were created, and visualising results. The package is able to handle missing forecasts and is the first R package to offer extensive support for forecasts represented through predictive quantiles, a format used by several collaborative ensemble forecasting efforts. The paper gives a short introduction to forecast evaluation, discusses the metrics implemented in scoringutils and gives guidance on when they are appropriate to use, and illustrates the application of the package using example data of forecasts for COVID-19 cases and deaths submitted to the European Forecast Hub between May and September 2021},

  abstract = {Abstract           Forecast evaluation plays an essential role in the development cycle of predictive epidemic models and can inform their use for public health decision-making. Common scores to evaluate epidemiological forecasts are the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) and the Weighted Interval Score (WIS), which are both measures of the absolute distance between the forecast distribution and the observation. They are commonly applied directly to predicted and observed incidence counts, but it can be questioned whether this yields the most meaningful results given the exponential nature of epidemic processes and the several orders of magnitude that observed values can span over space and time. In this paper, we argue that log transforming counts before applying scores such as the CRPS or WIS can effectively mitigate these difficulties and yield epidemiologically meaningful and easily interpretable results. We motivate the procedure threefold using the CRPS on log-transformed counts as an example: Firstly, it can be interpreted as a probabilistic version of a relative error. Secondly, it reflects how well models predicted the time-varying epidemic growth rate. And lastly, using arguments on variance-stabilizing transformations, it can be shown that under the assumption of a quadratic mean-variance relationship, the logarithmic transformation leads to expected CRPS values which are independent of the order of magnitude of the predicted quantity. Applying the log transformation to data and forecasts from the European COVID-19 Forecast Hub, we find that it changes model rankings regardless of stratification by forecast date, location or target types. Situations in which models missed the beginning of upward swings are more strongly emphasized while failing to predict a downturn following a peak is less severely penalized. We conclude that appropriate transformations, of which the natural logarithm is only one particularly attractive option, should be considered when assessing the performance of different models in the context of infectious disease incidence.},

  abstract = {For practical reasons, many forecasts of case, hospitalization, and death counts in the context of the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are issued in the form of central predictive intervals at various levels. This is also the case for the forecasts collected in the COVID-19 Forecast Hub (https://covid19forecasthub.org/). Forecast evaluation metrics like the logarithmic score, which has been applied in several infectious disease forecasting challenges, are then not available as they require full predictive distributions. This article provides an overview of how established methods for the evaluation of quantile and interval forecasts can be applied to epidemic forecasts in this format. Specifically, we discuss the computation and interpretation of the weighted interval score, which is a proper score that approximates the continuous ranked probability score. It can be interpreted as a generalization of the absolute error to probabilistic forecasts and allows for a decomposition into a measure of sharpness and penalties for over- and underprediction.},

Fifteen independent research teams provided forecasts at lead times of one through four weeks from January through mid-April 2021. Compared to the first part (October\textendash December 2020), the number of participating teams increased, and a number of teams started providing subnational-level forecasts. The addressed time period is characterized by rather stable non-pharmaceutical interventions in both countries, making short-term predictions more straightforward than in the first part of our study. In both countries, case counts declined initially, before rebounding due to the rise of the B.1.1.7 variant. Deaths declined through most of the study period in Germany while in Poland they increased after a prolonged plateau. Many, though not all, models outperformed a simple baseline model up to four weeks ahead, with ensemble methods showing very good relative performance. Major trend changes in reported cases, however, remained challenging to predict.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Short-term probabilistic forecasts of the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States have served as a visible and important communication channel between the scientific modeling community and both the general public and decision-makers. Forecasting models provide specific, quantitative, and evaluable predictions that inform short-term decisions such as healthcare staffing needs, school closures, and allocation of medical supplies. In 2020, the COVID-19 Forecast Hub (https://covid19forecasthub.org/) collected, disseminated, and synthesized hundreds of thousands of specific predictions from more than 50 different academic, industry, and independent research groups. This manuscript systematically evaluates 23 models that regularly submitted forecasts of reported weekly incident COVID-19 mortality counts in the US at the state and national level. One of these models was a multi-model ensemble that combined all available forecasts each week. The performance of individual models showed high variability across time, geospatial units, and forecast horizons. Half of the models evaluated showed better accuracy than a na\"ive baseline model. In combining the forecasts from all teams, the ensemble showed the best overall probabilistic accuracy of any model. Forecast accuracy degraded as models made predictions farther into the future, with probabilistic accuracy at a 20-week horizon more than 5 times worse than when predicting at a 1-week horizon. This project underscores the role that collaboration and active coordination between governmental public health agencies, academic modeling teams, and industry partners can play in developing modern modeling capabilities to support local, state, and federal response to outbreaks.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Infectious diseases impose considerable burden on society, despite significant advances in technology and medicine over the past century. Advanced warning can be helpful in mitigating and preparing for an impending or ongoing epidemic. Historically, such a capability has lagged for many reasons, including in particular the uncertainty in the current state of the system and in the understanding of the processes that drive epidemic trajectories. Presently we have access to data, models, and computational resources that enable the development of epidemiological forecasting systems. Indeed, several recent challenges hosted by the U.S. government have fostered an open and collaborative environment for the development of these technologies. The primary focus of these challenges has been to develop statistical and computational methods for epidemiological forecasting, but here we consider a serious alternative based on collective human judgment. We created the web-based ``Epicast'' forecasting system which collects and aggregates epidemic predictions made in real-time by human participants, and with these forecasts we ask two questions: how accurate is human judgment, and how do these forecasts compare to their more computational, data-driven alternatives? To address the former, we assess by a variety of metrics how accurately humans are able to predict influenza and chikungunya trajectories. As for the latter, we show that real-time, combined human predictions of the 2014\textendash 2015 and 2015\textendash 2016 U.S. flu seasons are often more accurate than the same predictions made by several statistical systems, especially for short-term targets. We conclude that there is valuable predictive power in collective human judgment, and we discuss the benefits and drawbacks of this approach.},

The aim of this paper is to develop methods for estimating reproduction numbers which are simple enough that they could be applied with limited data or in real time during an outbreak. I present a new estimator for the individual reproduction number, which describes the state of the epidemic at a point in time rather than tracking individuals over time, and discuss some potential benefits. Then, to capture more of the detail that micro-simulations have shown is important in outbreak dynamics, I analyse a model of transmission within and between households, and develop a method to estimate the household reproduction number, defined as the number of households infected by each infected household. This method is validated by numerical simulations of the spread of influenza and measles using historical data, and estimates are obtained for would-be emerging epidemics of these viruses. I argue that the household reproduction number is useful in assessing the impact of measures that target the household for isolation, quarantine, vaccination or prophylactic treatment, and measures such as social distancing and school or workplace closures which limit between-household transmission, all of which play a key role in current thinking on future infectious disease mitigation.},

We propose a diagnostic approach to the evaluation of predictive performance that is based on the paradigm of maximizing the sharpness of the predictive distributions subject to calibration. Calibration refers to the statistical consistency between the distributional forecasts and the observations and is a joint property of the predictions and the events that materialize. Sharpness refers to the concentration of the predictive distributions and is a property of the forecasts only. A simple theoretical framework allows us to distinguish between probabilistic calibration, exceedance calibration and marginal calibration. We propose and study tools for checking calibration and sharpness, among them the probability integral transform histogram, marginal calibration plots, the sharpness diagram and proper scoring rules. The diagnostic approach is illustrated by an assessment and ranking of probabilistic forecasts of wind speed at the Stateline wind energy centre in the US Pacific Northwest. In combination with cross-validation or in the time series context, our proposal provides very general, nonparametric alternatives to the use of information criteria for model diagnostics and model selection.},

  abstract = {From February to May 2020, experts in the modeling of infectious disease provided quantitative predictions and estimates of trends in the emerging COVID-19 pandemic in a series of 13 surveys. Data on existing transmission patterns were sparse when the pandemic began, but experts synthesized information available to them to provide quantitative, judgment-based assessments of the current and future state of the pandemic. We aggregated expert predictions into a single ``linear pool'' by taking an equally weighted average of their probabilistic statements. At a time when few computational models made public estimates or predictions about the pandemic, expert judgment provided (a) falsifiable predictions of short- and long-term pandemic outcomes related to reported COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, (b) estimates of latent viral transmission, and (c) counterfactual assessments of pandemic trajectories under different scenarios. The linear pool approach of aggregating expert predictions provided more consistently accurate predictions than any individual expert, although the predictive accuracy of a linear pool rarely provided the most accurate prediction. This work highlights the importance that an expert linear pool could play in flexibly assessing a wide array of risks early in future emerging outbreaks, especially in settings where available data cannot yet support data-driven computational modeling.},

  abstract = {Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, social and traditional media have disseminated predictions from experts and nonexperts about its expected magnitude. How accurate were the predictions of `experts'\textemdash individuals holding occupations or roles in subject-relevant fields, such as epidemiologists and statisticians\textemdash compared with those of the public? We conducted a survey in April 2020 of 140 UK experts and 2,086 UK laypersons; all were asked to make four quantitative predictions about the impact of COVID-19 by 31 Dec 2020. In addition to soliciting point estimates, we asked participants for lower and higher bounds of a range that they felt had a 75\% chance of containing the true answer. Experts exhibited greater accuracy and calibration than laypersons, even when restricting the comparison to a subset of laypersons who scored in the top quartile on a numeracy test. Even so, experts substantially underestimated the ultimate extent of the pandemic, and the mean number of predictions for which the expert intervals contained the actual outcome was only 1.8 (out of 4), suggesting that experts should consider broadening the range of scenarios they consider plausible. Predictions of the public were even more inaccurate and poorly calibrated, suggesting that an important role remains for expert predictions as long as experts acknowledge their uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Background  Short-term forecasts of infectious disease burden can contribute to  situational awareness and aid capacity planning. Based on best practice in  other fields and recent insights in infectious disease epidemiology, one can  maximise the predictive performance of such forecasts if multiple models are  combined into an ensemble. Here we report on the performance of ensembles in  predicting COVID-19 cases and deaths across Europe between 08 March 2021 and  07 March 2022. Methods  We used open-source tools to develop a public European COVID-19 Forecast  Hub. We invited groups globally to contribute weekly forecasts for COVID-19  cases and deaths reported from a standardised source over the next one to  four weeks. Teams submitted forecasts from March 2021 using standardised  quantiles of the predictive distribution. Each week we created an ensemble  forecast, where each predictive quantile was calculated as the  equally-weighted average (initially the mean and then from 26th July the  median) of all individual models' predictive quantiles. We measured the  performance of each model using the relative Weighted Interval Score (WIS),  comparing models' forecast accuracy relative to all other models. We  retrospectively explored alternative methods for ensemble forecasts,  including weighted averages based on models' past predictive  performance. Results  Over 52 weeks we collected and combined up to 28 forecast models for 32  countries. We found a weekly ensemble had a consistently strong performance  across countries over time. Across all horizons and locations, the ensemble  performed better on relative WIS than 84\% of participating models' forecasts  of incident cases (with a total N=862), and 92\% of participating models'  forecasts of deaths (N=746). Across a one to four week time horizon,  ensemble performance declined with longer forecast periods when forecasting  cases, but remained stable over four weeks for incident death forecasts. In  every forecast across 32 countries, the ensemble outperformed most  contributing models when forecasting either cases or deaths, frequently  outperforming all of its individual component models. Among several choices  of ensemble methods we found that the most influential and best choice was  to use a median average of models instead of using the mean, regardless of  methods of weighting component forecast models. Conclusions  Our results support the use of combining forecasts from individual  models into an ensemble in order to improve predictive performance across  epidemiological targets and populations during infectious disease epidemics.  Our findings further suggest that median ensemble methods yield better  predictive performance more than ones based on means. Our findings also  highlight that forecast consumers should place more weight on incident death  forecasts than incident case forecasts at forecast horizons greater than two  weeks.

  abstract = {Responding to a rapidly evolving pandemic like COVID-19 is challenging, and involves anticipating novel variants, vaccine uptake, and behavioral adaptations. Human judgment systems can complement computational models by providing valuable real-time forecasts. We report findings from a study conducted on Metaculus, a community forecasting platform, in partnership with the Virginia Department of Health, involving six rounds of forecasting during the Omicron BA.1 wave in the United States from November 2021 to March 2022. We received 8355 probabilistic predictions from 129 unique users across 60 questions pertaining to cases, hospitalizations, vaccine uptake, and peak/trough activity. We observed that the case forecasts performed on par with national multi-model ensembles and the vaccine uptake forecasts were more robust and accurate compared to baseline models. We also identified qualitative shifts in Omicron BA.1 wave prognosis during the surge phase, demonstrating rapid adaptation of such systems. Finally, we found that community estimates of variant characteristics such as growth rate and timing of dominance were in line with the scientific consensus. The observed accuracy, timeliness, and scope of such systems demonstrates the value of incorporating them into pandemic policymaking workflows.},
